## Local development

If you want to preview and develop localy, you will need to install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com)

Change the path to your files in `Gruntfile.js` for `http-server.dev.root`

Run this with

```bash
$ grunt
```

You can preview your site at http://localhost:8100 or http://127.0.0.1:8100
